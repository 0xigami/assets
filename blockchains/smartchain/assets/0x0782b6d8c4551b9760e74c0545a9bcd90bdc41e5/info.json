    "description": "The Helio.Money protocol, powered by the BNB chain, introduces an innovative architecture to stablecoin minting. Helioâ€™s stablecoin is called HAY, and it is over-collateralized with BNB tokens. To obtain HAY, the user will need to provide BNB collateral and borrow HAY against it. After that, HAY can be staked for long-term yield and transferred to other protocols to generate additional yield. HAY is over-collateralized, making its peg highly secure and comparable to the MakerDAO DAI token.",
